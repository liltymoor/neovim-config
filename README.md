# neovim-config
ASM-oriented NVIM configuration, made with curious intensity.

# Installation:
This config uses lazy plugin-manager - it means that we must use nvim >= 0.8.0 . 
(Ubuntu example)

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable -y

After that you need to update, to add installed PPA.

	sudo apt update

And now you can feel free to install neovim.

	sudo apt install neovim

Backup/Remove your current config with this:

	rm -rf ~/.config/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.cache/nvim

Now you're ready to install this config

	git clone ~/.config/nvim/ https://github.com/liltymoor/neovim-config.git

**Cheat-Sheet will appear here later.**
